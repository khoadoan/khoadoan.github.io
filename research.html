<!-- Here at **MAIL**, We develop computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses. We focus on improving the following aspects of existing models: (i) training/inference, (ii) realistic assumptions, (iii) algorithmic robustness, and (iv) efficiency in constrained settings. Most of our ML/AI solutions center around large-scale approaches that have low computational complexity and require less human effort.  -->

<!-- Our research seek answers to the following question: *Are existing ML methods simple to use and reliable for practical uses*? **Simplicity**, given the context where ML is to be deployed, refers to the ability to (i) feasibly build or implement the method, (ii) execute the deployed model efficiently, and (iii) evolve the deployed model with less effort. **Reliability** relates to (i) whether we can rely on the model to solve the intended task well, (ii) whether this performance is preserved under frequently perturbed environments in practice such as data corruptions or distributional changes, and (iii) whether the model is resilient to (i.e., its performance is not significantly affected by) various forms of security attacks such as adversarial examples and causal attacks. In this sense, I believe that many existing ML methods, including those with *complex* deep neural networks (DNNs), are *reliable in ideal and high-resource settings* but *not yet reliable and simple to use given real-world constraints*. The effort to answer this question will help us truly realize the potential of AI/ML methodology in practice, further advancing its societal benefits, especially for many low-resource and low-income communities that have yet equally benefitted from these advancements. -->

<p>Our research seek answers to the following question: <em>Are existing ML, and recently MLLM, simple, reliable, and secure to use in practical applications?</em> Here, <strong>simplicity</strong>, given <em>the context</em> of the model deployment, refers to the ability to (i) feasibly build or adapt the method, (ii) execute the deployed model efficiently, and (iii) evolve the deployed model with less effort. <strong>Reliability</strong> measures (i) how well the model understands real-world contexts (e.g., spatial and multi-lingual/cultural) and solves the intended task well, and (ii) how much of this performance is preserved under frequently perturbed, practical environments such as data corruptions or distributional changes. Finally, <strong>Security</strong> refers to the model’s resilience against various forms of security vulnerabilities, such as exploratory and causal attacks.</p>

<p>Although many ML methods are <em>reliable in ideal and high-resource settings</em>, we believe that they remain fragile and difficult to deploy under real-world constraints – often failing to maintain their performance, adaptability, and usability. Addressing this gap is central to our research, as it will enable us to realize the true potential of ML in practice – translating methodological progress into tangible societal impact, particularly for low-resource and underserved communities that have yet to fully benefit from these advancements.</p>

<p>Our current research scope roughly falls into the 4 different areas: (1) understanding of security vulnerabilities, (2) assessment of modern ML systems in real-world conditions, (3) mechanistic interpretation and theoretical understanding of real-world failure modes, (4) efficient control (during training and inference) of the models for practical use.</p>

<!-- Our research focuses on understanding the practical limits of using existing ML methods in the real-world. Essential, we seek answers to the following question: *How to make ML models simpler & reliable to use in constrained settings*? **Simplicity** refers to the ability to (i) build or implement the method easily, (ii) execute the deployed model efficiently, and (iii) evolve the deployed model with less effort. **Reliability** relates to (i) whether we can rely on the model to solve the intended task well, (ii) whether this performance is preserved under frequently perturbed environments in practice such as data corruptions or distributional changes, and (iii) whether the model is resilient to (i.e., its performance is not significantly affected by) various forms of security attacks such as adversarial examples and causal attacks. In this sense, we believe that many existing ML methods, including those with *complex* deep neural networks, are *reliable* but *not yet easy-to-use* because they do not satisfy various constraints seen in real-world applications. We also strongly believe the effort to answer this question will help us truly realize the potential of AI/ML methodology in practice.   -->

<!-- Our goal, therefore, is to develop computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses.

<p>One of our lifelong passions is to catalyze equitable access to AI tools and approaches in low-resource and low-income communities, starting with the development of high-quality, culture-aware benchmarking systems, and ending with suitable solutions to adapt the existing ML models with satisfactory performance and efficient resource utilization. <strong>This effort will help democratize knowledge in these communities, significantly improving the quality of life of their citizens.</strong></p>

<p>Consequently, a large part of our research is now devoted to solving various societal challenges with AI in low-resource communities. We’re working on problems such as low-resource NLP, low-resource remote-sensing predictive algorithms, cross-cultural language understanding, and visual question answering algorithms for medical domain.
