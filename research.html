<p>Our research seek answers to the following question: <em>Are existing ML methods simple to use and reliable for practical uses</em>? <strong>Simplicity</strong>, given the context where ML is to be deployed, refers to the ability to (i) feasibly build or implement the method, (ii) execute the deployed model efficiently, and (iii) evolve the deployed model with less effort. <strong>Reliability</strong> relates to (i) whether we can rely on the model to solve the intended task well, (ii) whether this performance is preserved under frequently perturbed environments in practice such as data corruptions or distributional changes, and (iii) whether the model is resilient to (i.e., its performance is not significantly affected by) various forms of security attacks such as adversarial examples and causal attacks. In this sense, I believe that many existing ML methods, including those with <em>complex</em> deep neural networks (DNNs), are <em>reliable in ideal and high-resource settings</em> but <em>not yet reliable and simple to use given real-world constraints</em>. The effort to answer this question will help us truly realize the potential of AI/ML methodology in practice, further advancing its societal benefits, especially for many low-resource and low-income communities that have yet equally benefitted from these advancements.</p>

<!-- Our research focuses on understanding the practical limits of using existing ML methods in the real-world. Essential, we seek answers to the following question: *How to make ML models simpler & reliable to use in constrained settings*? **Simplicity** refers to the ability to (i) build or implement the method easily, (ii) execute the deployed model efficiently, and (iii) evolve the deployed model with less effort. **Reliability** relates to (i) whether we can rely on the model to solve the intended task well, (ii) whether this performance is preserved under frequently perturbed environments in practice such as data corruptions or distributional changes, and (iii) whether the model is resilient to (i.e., its performance is not significantly affected by) various forms of security attacks such as adversarial examples and causal attacks. In this sense, we believe that many existing ML methods, including those with *complex* deep neural networks, are *reliable* but *not yet easy-to-use* because they do not satisfy various constraints seen in real-world applications. We also strongly believe the effort to answer this question will help us truly realize the potential of AI/ML methodology in practice.   -->

<p>Our goal, therefore, is to develop computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses. We focus on studying and improving the following aspects of existing ML models: (i) <strong>training</strong>, (ii) <strong>inference</strong>, (iii) <strong>realistic assumptions</strong>, and (iv) <strong>security/robustness</strong>. Our current research scope roughly falls into the following areas or themes:

<p>We first aim to investigate the security and reliability issues of existing ML models under various forms of attacks – including causative attacks (such as trojan/backdoor attacks) and exploratory attacks (such as adversarial examples) – and test-time distributional changes, then develop suitable countermeasures and mitigation approaches to ensure their safe and effective deployment in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>One of our lifelong passions is to catalyze equitable access to AI tools and approaches in low-resource and low-income communities, starting with the development of high-quality, culture-aware benchmarking systems, and ending with suitable solutions to adapt the existing ML models with satisfactory performance and efficient resource utilization. <strong>This effort will help democratize knowledge in these communities, significantly improving the quality of life of their citizens.</strong></p>

<p>Consequently, a large part of our research is now devoted to solving various societal challenges with AI in low-resource communities. We’re working on problems such as low-resource NLP, low-resource remote-sensing predictive algorithms, cross-cultural language understanding, and visual question answering algorithms for medical domain.
